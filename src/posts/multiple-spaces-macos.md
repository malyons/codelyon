> **TLDR:**
> *System Preferences* > *Mission Control* > *Displays have separate Spaces* must be checked

Recently I found myself trying to keep my resource usage down on an old Mac Mini and MacBook Pro. Trying to run all the things I’m used to on a more performant machine limited me in what I was doing. Fun fact, on this machine, running Outlook and Skype at the same time causes it to completely freeze and be unresponsive during a video call.

In order to set things up for multiple displays and workspaces you need to go into *System Preferences* and select *Mission Control*.

Make sure that *Displays have separate Spaces* is selected. If not, select it after which you’ll need to Log Out in order for this setting to take effect.

Now you’ll be able to have more than one *Main Space* across displays. No longer will your extra desktops be across all displays either.
