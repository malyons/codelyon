As with anything related to software development, or personal use, opinions abound and zealots form on all sides. I’m not saying that the applications I use in my day to day are what everyone should use, but after a significant amount of testing I’ve found them to be quite useful. They’ve become daily uses for me, and I hope some of them might prove useful to you as well.</p>\n<p><a href="https://brew.sh/" title="Homebrew Homepage">Homebrew</a></p>\n<p>If you didn’t know before, you can use brew to manage a lot more than just CLI tools. Brew Cask will install a wide range of products that are available online, the only caveat is if an application is only available on the App Store. In that case <a href="https://github.com/mas-cli/mas" title="mas github repo">Mac App Store CLI</a> can help with that. Mas is like brew, but for the App Store. You have to have already downloaded the app once from the store with your Apple ID, so it won’t work for the initial install, but it goes a decent way toward setting up a fresh MacBook. Personally, I find using brew to be faster than going to a site, downloading a tar, unpacking, and everything. Brew handles all of that for you, and the most important part wipes it all when you want to uninstall whatever app/package you installed. Adding/removing things from your PATH, the works.<br><br></p>\n<p><a href="http://www.bear-writer.com/" title="Bear Homepage">Bear</a></p>\n<p>I recently switched to Bear after having used Evernote for four years, and while I liked Evernote, I love Bear. For one, Bear is <strong>fast</strong> and looks fantastic, as one would expect since it was created by a design based company. It’s also fairly inexpensive for a premium subscription ($14.99 per year), even though it has a fully featured freemium model. The main thing free tier is missing is the ability to sync notes across devices and to unlock more themes.</p>\n<p>My <a href="https://www.codelyon.com/" title="codelyon.com">blog</a>, for example, is built using Hugo, a static site generator that uses Markdown to generate posts, which Bear is compatible with unlike Evernote. Having the ability to keep post ideas, daily lists, notes, and the posts themselves all in one location is super handy.<br><br></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com/" title="Spectacle Homepage">Spectacle</a></p>\n<p>One of the most annoying parts of MacOS, to me at least, is window management, more like the lack thereof. Coming from Windows I was used to the fancy drag to the side of the screen and the OS resizes the window to fit for me. I missed that when switching to Mac, and while Spectacle isn’t <em>quite</em> the same, it’s pretty damn close.</p>\n<p>Spectacle works via keyboard shortcuts, which is nice if you spend a <strong>lot</strong> of time using one. Open source, and completely free. You can resize to fill the full screen, center a window, halves, thirds, quarters. It’s quick, easy, and becomes second nature relatively quickly.<br><br></p>\n<p><a href="https://cordlessdog.com/stay/" title="Stay Homepage">Stay</a></p>\n<p>Another annoying thing about MacOS, and OS X before it, is the tendency for windows to disappear or be completely offscreen when using multiple displays. Unplugging from multiple screens, working on a single display, then plugging back into your multi-screen setup often results in desktop rearranging and missing windows. First world problems, I know, but sometimes you just want things to be how they were the last time you were using it. Stay “stores” your application windows for you, and will restore them when asked to. This way if you run into any of this window hiding BS, you can easily restore them without having to kill the application and restart it.<br><br></p>\n<p><a href="https://justgetflux.com/" title="Flux Homepage">f.lux</a></p>\n<p>I’m probably not the only one, but I tend to turn the brightness <strong>way</strong> down on my screens, MacBook and secondary screens. I’ve had problems in the past with headaches which I’ve attributed to a combination of bright screens and outdated glasses, though I typically only wear them while driving. Still, flux is intended to help with eye strain and filtering out the blue light that keeps our brains from getting tired at night. Obviously, this doesn’t work so well if you need to have color accuracy, but for the majority of my time, I have a slight yellow tinge to my display.<br><br></p>\n<p><a href="http://tomighty.org/" title="Tomighty Page">Tomighty</a></p>\n<p>Oh the mighty Pomodoro. Seriously, I’ve gotten more done since adopting this technique than I could have hoped for. Granted some days it’s easier than others to focus on tasks. I find that breaking things up into 25 min blocks is great, and Tomighty really helps out. With keyboard shortcuts and the tracking of how many I’ve completed, this is one of the first apps I install when setting up a new machine.<br><br></p>\n<p><a href="http://airmailapp.com/" title="Airmail Homepage">Airmail</a></p>\n<p>Personally, I find the default Mail app to be incredibly slow. I was introduced to Airmail by a former coworker, in the beginning, I really didn’t want to try it due to it not being a free solution. Being a broke college student at the time, I couldn\'t really justify it. However, I don’t think I’ll ever go back. With the ability to handle a significant amount of inboxes, smart folders, and automation rules to handle different types of mail, this client has everything I need in a sleek, fast package.<br><br></p>\n<p><a href="https://app.grammarly.com/" title="Grammarly Homepage">Grammarly</a></p>\n<p>I use the free version but have considered getting a subscription. I write enough and forget how to spell enough to justify it. The better part of this app is the grammar enhancement.<br><br></p>\n<p><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/" title="Alfred Homepage">Alfred</a></p>\n<p>When I first discovered Spotlight I couldn’t believe it. I can open applications without having to open the finder, or the dock, or an icon on the desktop. I started reading and hearing about Alfred in articles and podcasts, so I knew I had to give it a shot. The free version is very powerful, the ability to open applications and files, search Google (or your browser of choice) with customizable hotkeys and extensibility was pretty awesome. I stuck with the free version for nearly a year before finally buying a license, workflows are what convinced me after reading about the <a href="http://devdocs.io/" title="devdocs Homepage">devdocs</a> integration. Now I have the ability to search offline documentation for nearly any language and/or framework. I’ve barely scratched the surface of what this tool can do, and could likely write an entire post on it alone.</p>',excerpt:"We all have a process and a preference for how we do things.
